Rethink naming for process, triggers etc...

Make the code easy to alter by isolating values that should be altered
- Produce some sort of documentation...?

Think about how to handle errors in serial connection
- Handhsakes?

Remove subprocess class and just make process objects within one larger process object for each inidvidual 'trigger'?
