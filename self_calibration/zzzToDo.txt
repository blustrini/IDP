ToDo List

----------------------------
STYLE CHOICES
----------------------------

Make the code easy to alter by isolating values that should be altered
- Produce some sort of documentation...?

----------------------------
ARDUINO IMPLEMENTATION - RAY
----------------------------

Think about how to handle buffer getting too large
- Temporarily stop Arduino loop, let python catch up

- Calibration: find motor speeds that make the robot go straight, ultrasound sensor calibration

----------------------------
MAIN PYTHON PROCESS - BERNARDO
----------------------------

Write the self-calibration algorithm using the dimensions of the arena. (Maybe expect a user input or something)
- One problem is how to trigger additional functions through dictionary process.
- Maybe trigger upon changing state, and write change state method in Task object
	that performs actions based on state change!

Implement instruction write onto the serial

When buffer is too large, search through the buffer for most important functions

Eventually, rewrite the main processor objects to be able to be applied for any task
	upon initialisation by passing dictionaries into it

MIGHT BE USEFUL LATER

{How to handle interrupts from python? (research)} (not rly useful) (try, catch)
