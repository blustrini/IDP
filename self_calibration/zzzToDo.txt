ToDo List

----------------------------
STYLE CHOICES
----------------------------

Rethink naming for process, triggers etc...

Make the code easy to alter by isolating values that should be altered
- Produce some sort of documentation...?

----------------------------
ARDUINO IMPLEMENTATION
----------------------------

Write arduino functions for various instructions from python to arduino (convert instruction like turn left to motor controls).

Think about how to handle errors in serial connection
- Handhsakes?

Remove port dependency of serial connection

----------------------------
MAIN PYTHON PROCESS
----------------------------

Remove subprocess class and just make process objects within one larger process object for each inidvidual 'trigger'?

Write the self-calibration algorithm using the dimensions of the arena. (Maybe expect a user input or something)

Write 'subprocesses for each expected trigger from arduino, depending on the stage

How to handle interrupts from python? (research)
